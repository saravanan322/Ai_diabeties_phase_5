This section describes the working procedures and implementation of various machine learning techniques to design the proposed automatic diabetes prediction system. Figure 1 shows the different stages of this research work
In this work, various machine learning and ensemble techniques have been employed to implement the automatic diabetes prediction system, briefly discussed below. GridSearchCV framework has been employed in this research to find the optimal values of different hyperparameters for all the machine learning models to prevent overfitting
